login_script
============
This project is made to help those who want to incorporate a user login system into their website using PHP and MySQL. Please note that this project may not be the most secure, especially the first commits. As time goes on, the level of security that this user login system provides will increase.

<h4>This is just a basic outline of a user login system</h4>
This is just the bare bones of a user login system. More can be added to it, depending on your needs. 

<h4>TODO</h4>

<li>Add more to README.md</li>
<li>Add detailed instructions on how to incorporate into website</li>
<li>Add a TODO.md page instead of listing TODO on README.md</li>
</ol>
